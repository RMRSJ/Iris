# Iris Project
The Iris dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset to understand exploratory analysis, clasification, clustering and feature selection. It is particularly popular due to its simplicity and the clear separation of the different species based on the features provided - you can easily see clear separation of species when we complete exploratory analysis and machine learning exercises. The data lends itself to demonstrate the impact of continuous data in machine learning. 

**Data Literacy**
150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Sepal Length: The length of the iris flower's sepals (the green leaf-like structures that encase the flower bud).
Sepal Width: The width of the iris flower's sepals.
Petal Length: The length of the iris flower's petals (the colored structures of the flower).
Petal Width: The width of the iris flower's petals.
Iris setosa: Characterized by its relatively small size, with distinctive characteristics in sepal and petal dimensions.
Iris versicolor: Moderate in size, with features falling between those of Iris setosa and Iris virginica.
Iris virginica: Generally larger in size, with notable differences in sepal and petal dimensions compared to the other two species.

For machine learning exercises, the target variable is the species of the iris flower, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width of each Iris flower will be used to predict which species of Iris it belongs to - classification.
